Q.1 Add a colon to the end of the html_document field in the YAML header to further customize the knitted file.
Q.2 Below the html_document field, add a table of contents to the YAML header using the toc field.
Q.3 Below the toc field, specify a header depth of 2 for the table of contents using toc_depth.
Q.4 Below the toc_depth field, add numbered sections to the document using number_sections.
Q.5 Modify the headers in the document by removing one hash from each header, so that the largest header starts with a single hash and the section numbering will start with a 1.
Q.6 Below the toc field, add toc_float and a colon at the end of the field.
Q.7 On a new line, add another indentation and the collapsed field, so that the full table of contents remains visible throughout the report.
Q.8 Add another line and add the smooth_scroll field so that page scrolls are not animated.

## Datasets 

### Investment Annual Summary
The `investment_annual_summary` dataset provides a summary of the dollars in millions provided to each region for each fiscal year, from 2012 to 2018.
```{r investment-annual-summary}
ggplot(investment_annual_summary, aes(x = fiscal_year, y = dollars_in_millions, color = region)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Annual Summary",
    x = "Fiscal Year",
    y = "Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil
The `investment_services_projects` dataset provides information about each investment project from 2012 to 2018. Information listed includes the project name, company name, sector, project status, and investment amounts. Projects that do not have an associated investment amount are excluded from the plot.

```{r brazil-investment-projects}
brazil_investment_projects <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == "Brazil") 

ggplot(brazil_investment_projects, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in Brazil",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  )
```

### Investment Projects in Brazil in 2018
The `investment_services_projects` dataset was filtered below to focus on information about each investment project from the 2018 fiscal year, and is referred to as `brazil_investment_projects_2018`. Projects that do not have an associated investment amount are excluded from the plot.

```{r brazil-investment-projects-2018}
brazil_investment_projects_2018 <- investment_services_projects %>%
  filter(country == "Brazil",
         date_disclosed >= "2017-07-01",
         date_disclosed <= "2018-06-30") 

ggplot(brazil_investment_projects_2018, aes(x = date_disclosed, y = total_investment, color = status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Investment Services Projects in Brazil in 2018",
    x = "Date Disclosed",
    y = "Total IFC Investment in Dollars in Millions"
  )
